### README.md for CSV Data Parser

# CSV Data Parser

## Overview
This Ruby script is designed to efficiently parse and transform CSV data, enhancing the usability of large datasets. It features robust error handling, logging, and data integrity checks to ensure the process is reliable and maintainable. The parser is particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be cleaned or transformed before use in analytical applications.

## Features
- ### Error Handling: The script handles errors gracefully, ensuring the application remains robust even when processing corrupted data.
- ### Logging: Integrated logging provides real-time feedback on the process status and helps in diagnosing issues post-process.
- ### Data Transformation: Includes data validation and transformation, ensuring that the data conforms to required formats before processing.

## Prerequisites
- Ruby (Version 2.7 or newer recommended)
- CSV and Date libraries (part of Ruby's standard library)

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enhanced-csv-data-parser.git
cd enhanced-csv-data-parser
```

## Usage
To use the Enhanced CSV Data Parser, you need to specify the input and output file paths in the script. Modify the `input_path` and `output_path` variables in the script to point to your specific CSV files.

```ruby
input_path = 'path/to/your/input.csv'
output_path = 'path/to/your/output.csv'
parser = EnhancedCsvDataParser.new(input_path, output_path)
parser.parse_and_transform
```

Run the script from the command line:
```bash
ruby enhanced_csv_data_parser.rb
```

## Logging
The script logs its progress and any errors encountered to the standard output. You can redirect these logs to a file if required for further analysis.
